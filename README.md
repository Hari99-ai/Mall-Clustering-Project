# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation using Clustering (K-Means)

This project demonstrates the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. We apply K-Means clustering to discover patterns and target groups for business decision-making in a shopping mall context.

## 📊 Key Highlights

- ✅ Worked with a real-world-style dataset containing **200 mall customers**.
- ✅ Applied **K-Means clustering** with optimal **`k = 5` clusters**, determined using the **Elbow Method**.
- ✅ Preprocessed data using **pandas**, and scaled features using **StandardScaler** for accurate distance-based clustering.
- ✅ Visualized clusters using 2D scatter plots, cluster centroids, and customer distributions.
- ✅ Explained business implications for each identified customer segment.
